# Service Installer Scheduler - Storybook

Welcome to the Storybook documentation for the Service Installer Scheduler application!

## What is this?

This Storybook contains interactive component examples demonstrating the key UI patterns and components used in the application. Each story showcases different states and interactions of the components.

## Available Stories

### 1. Orders List Example
Demonstrates the orders table with filtering, sorting, and Excel export functionality.

### 2. Installer Schedule View
Shows the drag-and-drop scheduling interface with time slots and installer assignments.

### 3. Order Detail Form
Displays the view/edit form for individual orders with validation and history tracking.

### 4. Time Slot Settings
Demonstrates the admin interface for managing customizable time slots with drag-and-drop reordering.

## Running Storybook

```bash
# Start Storybook development server
pnpm storybook

# Build static Storybook
pnpm build-storybook
```

## Component Architecture

All components follow these principles:

- **tRPC Integration**: Components use `trpc.*` hooks for data fetching and mutations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback with automatic rollback on errors
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with generated types from tRPC procedures
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels throughout

## Mock Data

Stories use realistic mock data from `docs/stories/mocks/mockData.ts`. This allows testing components in isolation without requiring a live backend.
